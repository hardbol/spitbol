/*
/   doexec( scptr )
/
/   doexec() does an "execle" function call to invoke the shell on the
/   command string contained in the passed SCBLK.
/
/   Parameters:
/	scptr	pointer to SCBLK containing the command to execute
/   Returns:
/	No return if shell successfully executed
/	Returns if could not execute command
/
/
/	1.03	15-Oct-91	Intel bug in system() command.  Malloc must
/						allocate out of high memory to allow spawn to
/						work properly.  We set a global switch that
/						tells malloc to use sbrk to satisfy memory
/						request made by spawn() and system().
